# Authentication Integration Test Scenarios

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive test scenarios for validating the integration between wallet connection (`useMultiWallet`) and university voting authentication (`useUniversityVoting`). The tests ensure that both authentication systems work together seamlessly to provide secure access to voting functionality.

## Authentication Flow Integration Overview

### Integration Architecture

The authentication integration works as follows:

1. **Wallet Connection State**: `useMultiWallet` hook manages wallet connection state
2. **Authentication State**: `useUniversityVoting` hook manages user authentication state
3. **Combined Validation**: Both states are required for certain operations
4. **State Synchronization**: Changes in one state can affect the other
5. **Security Enforcement**: Operations require both authentication and wallet connection

### User Roles and Requirements

- **Admin**: Requires authentication + wallet connection for admin functions
- **Candidate**: Requires authentication + wallet connection for candidate functions
- **Voter**: Requires authentication + wallet connection for voting functions
- **Guest**: Limited access without authentication or wallet

### Critical Test Cases

The following test cases are considered critical and must pass for authentication integration to be considered successful:

- AI001: Login flow with wallet already connected
- AI005: Logout flow disconnects both auth and wallet
- AI011: Vote casting requires both authentication and wallet
- AI016: Election creation requires admin auth and wallet
- AI031: Wallet address matches authenticated user
- AI035: Wallet disconnection invalidates certain operations

### Test Execution Notes

- All tests should be executed with multiple user roles
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices
- Test with different wallet providers
- Document any role-specific behavior differences
- Record actual results and notes for each test case
- Update test cases based on findings

### Next Steps After Testing

1. Review all test results and identify patterns
2. Fix any failed test cases
3. Update test cases based on actual behavior
4. Create automated tests for critical flows
5. Document any issues and their resolutions
6. Plan production deployment
