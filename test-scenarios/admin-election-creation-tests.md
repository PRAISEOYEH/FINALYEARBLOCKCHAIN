### AEC034: Concurrent Election Creation Attempts

**Objective**: Test system behavior with concurrent election creation attempts

**Preconditions**:
- Multiple admin sessions possible
- Election creation forms ready

**Test Steps**:
1. Start election creation in session 1
2. Start election creation in session 2
3. Verify both processes work
4. Test transaction ordering
5. Verify both elections created
6. Test data consistency

**Expected Results**:
- Both creations work independently
- Transactions ordered correctly
- Both elections created successfully
- Data consistent across elections
- No conflicts or corruption

**Validation Criteria**:
- Independence maintained
- Ordering correct
- Both successful
- Data consistent
- No conflicts

**Error Handling**:
- Conflicts should be prevented
- Ordering should be maintained
- Data integrity should be preserved
- Errors should be handled gracefully

### AEC035: Election Creation with Invalid Admin Wallet

**Objective**: Test election creation with invalid admin wallet

**Preconditions**:
- Non-admin wallet connected
- Election creation attempted

**Test Steps**:
1. Connect non-admin wallet
2. Attempt election creation
3. Verify access control
4. Test error message
5. Verify prevention of creation
6. Test admin wallet requirement

**Expected Results**:
- Access control enforced
- Clear error message displayed
- Creation prevented
- Admin requirement clear
- Security maintained

**Validation Criteria**:
- Access control works
- Error message clear
- Creation prevented
- Admin requirement enforced
- Security maintained

**Error Handling**:
- Access should be denied
- Error message should explain requirement
- Creation should be prevented
- Security should be maintained
