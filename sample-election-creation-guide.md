   - Verify other options (Ranked Choice, Approval Voting) are available

4. **Candidacy Deposit Settings**

## Step 8: Review University Information

1. **University Context Alert**

   - Verify dates are logical and in correct sequence

## Step 9: Create the Election

1. **Submit Election**
   - Click the "üó≥Ô∏è Create Student Union Election" button at the bottom
   - The button should be enabled (not grayed out) if all required fields are filled
   - Button text should change to "Creating Election..." during processing

2. **Monitor Creation Process**
   - Wait for the creation process to complete
   - This may take several seconds as it interacts with the blockchain
   - Do not close the dialog during this process

3. **Verify Success**
   - Look for a green success alert that appears after creation
   - The alert should display: "Election Created Successfully!"
   - A smart contract address should be shown (format: 0x followed by 40 characters)

## Step 10: Validation and Verification

1. **Contract Address Verification**
   - Copy the displayed contract address
   - Verify it follows the format: `0x[40 hexadecimal characters]`
   - This address represents the blockchain smart contract for your election

2. **Form Reset Confirmation**
   - After successful creation, the form should reset to default values
   - All fields should be cleared except default selections
   - Position selections should be cleared

3. **Close Dialog and Check Elections List**
   - Close the creation dialog
   - Navigate to the "Elections" tab if not already selected
   - Verify your new election appears in the elections list

4. **Election Details Verification**
   - Confirm the election card shows:
     - Title: "Student Union Elections Fall 2024"
     - Academic Year: "2024-2025"
     - Semester: "Fall Semester"
     - Status: "upcoming" (since voting hasn't started)
     - Contract address (truncated): First 10 characters + "..."
     - Positions: 7
     - Candidates: 0 (initially)

## Step 11: Blockchain Integration Validation

1. **Thirdweb Service Integration**
   - The election creation uses the Thirdweb service for blockchain interaction
   - Verify the contract address returned is valid and deployed on Base Sepolia
   - Check that the admin wallet address has sufficient Base Sepolia ETH for transactions

2. **API Route Validation**
   - The creation process calls `/api/admin/create-election`
   - This route validates admin permissions and reads the deployed contract address
   - Verify the API successfully interacts with the blockchain

3. **Environment Configuration Check**
   - Ensure `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS` is properly set
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=84532` for Base Sepolia
   - Confirm `THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID` are configured

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Election Creation Fails
- **Check Admin Permissions**: Ensure you're logged in with admin credentials
- **Verify Network**: Confirm you're connected to Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532)
- **Check Wallet Balance**: Ensure admin wallet has sufficient ETH for gas fees
- **Validate Form Data**: Ensure all required fields are completed correctly

### Contract Address Not Displayed
- **Check API Response**: Verify the `/api/admin/create-election` route returns successfully
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set
- **Network Configuration**: Confirm the deployed contract exists on the current network

### Form Validation Errors
- **Required Fields**: Ensure title, dates, and at least one position are selected
- **Date Logic**: Verify campaign dates come before voting dates
- **Position Selection**: Confirm at least one position is selected

### Blockchain Integration Issues
- **Thirdweb Configuration**: Verify Thirdweb client ID and secret key are valid
- **Contract Deployment**: Ensure the contract is properly deployed on Base Sepolia
- **Network Connectivity**: Check internet connection and RPC endpoint availability
