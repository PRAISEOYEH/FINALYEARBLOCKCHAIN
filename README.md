## Project Overview

This repository implements a decentralized voting system for university elections. Key components:

- `contracts/UniversityVoting.sol`: A Solidity smart contract that manages elections, positions, candidates, voter whitelisting, and vote casting.
- Next.js frontend: User and admin interfaces for creating elections, verifying candidates, whitelisting voters, and casting votes.
- Blockchain integration: Wallet connection and transactions driven by wagmi + viem; read operations use public RPC clients; write operations use connected wallet clients.
- Server-side admin APIs: Admin-only operations can be executed via server-side admin flow (using server wallet signatures or an admin service).
- ID mapping: A deterministic mapping layer that maps human-friendly UI IDs to onchain uint256 IDs to keep routes and references stable.

Goals:
- Secure, auditable vote recording on-chain
- Admin tooling for election lifecycle management
- Clear developer experience for compiling, deploying, and integrating contracts

## Quickstart / Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- Basic familiarity with Ethereum wallets and RPC providers
- (Optional) A funded test wallet for Base Sepolia to perform transactions

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd FINALYEARBLOCKCHAIN
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Generate package-lock.json (if needed)**
   ```bash
   # Run the automated script to generate reproducible builds
   generate-lockfile.bat
   ```

4. **Create environment file**
   - Copy example and edit values:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env.local
     ```
   - Minimum environment variables required for blockchain mode (recommended `.env.local`):
     - NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_BLOCKCHAIN=true
     - NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=84532
     - NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
     - NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id_here
     - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS= (optional override; otherwise resolved from deployed-addresses.json)
     - ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourAdminAddressHere
     - PRIVATE_KEY=your_server_admin_private_key (only for server-side admin flows; never commit)
   - See the "Environment variables" section below for a full list.

5. **Compile contracts and generate ABIs**
   ```bash
   npm run hh:compile
   npm run generate:abi
   ```
   This will compile contracts and populate `lib/contracts` with ABIs used by the frontend.

6. **Start a local Hardhat node for testing (optional)**
   ```bash
   npm run hh:node
   ```
   Deploy to local node:
   ```bash
   npm run hh:deploy:localhost
   ```

7. **Deploy to Base Sepolia (testnet)**
   - Ensure PRIVATE_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL are set for the deployment account
   ```bash
   npm run hh:compile
   npm run hh:deploy:baseSepolia
   ```
   After deployment, `lib/contracts/deployed-addresses.json` is updated with the contract address for `baseSepolia`.

8. **Start the Next.js application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000

## Environment Variables

Below are the key environment variables used by the project. Use `.env.local` for development (do not commit secrets).

- NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_BLOCKCHAIN=true|false
  - Toggle between onchain mode (true) and mock mode (false). Default recommended: true.

- NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID
  - Chain ID used in the app. For Base Sepolia set to 84532.

- NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL
  - RPC endpoint used by public clients (reads). Example: https://sepolia.base.org

- NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID
  - WalletConnect v2 project id (if using WalletConnect connector).

- NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
  - Optional override for the deployed contract address used by the client. If omitted, server-side resolves address from `lib/contracts/deployed-addresses.json` using the chain id mapping.

- ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS
  - The admin wallet address expected by server-side admin routes for lightweight checks.

- PRIVATE_KEY
  - Private key used by server-side scripts or admin API to sign transactions (only for server-side; never bundle this for client).

- THIRDWEB keys (optional/legacy)
  - THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID â€” only if you opt into thirdweb admin flows.

Security note: Never commit .env files containing PRIVATE_KEY or other secrets to source control.

## Provider & App Initialization (Notes for Developers)

The recommended provider hierarchy inside `app/layout.tsx`:
- ThemeProvider (UI theming)
  - QueryClientProvider (TanStack Query)
    - WagmiConfig (configured with wagmi + viem clients and connectors)
      - UniversityVotingProvider (app-specific context wrapping React Query hooks)
        - Application UI

Key wagmi features used:
- connectors: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet via `@wagmi/connectors`
- hooks: useAccount, useConnect, useDisconnect, useSwitchChain, useBalance, etc.
- publicClient / walletClient pattern for read/write separation (viem integration)

---

## Usage Guide

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - Open the wallet connection UI (header / login page).
   - Choose connector: MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase Wallet.
   - Use useSwitchChain to prompt user to switch to Base Sepolia (chainId 84532) if they're on the wrong network.
   - After connecting, the UI shows account address, balance and network status.

2. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Admin must connect the admin wallet (ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS) to perform admin flows or call server admin APIs which sign using PRIVATE_KEY.
   - Create election: Fill in election title, description, start & end timestamps, and initial positions; the dashboard calls `/api/admin/create-election` or directly creates onchain tx via connected admin wallet.
   - Verify candidates: Approve or verify candidates using server route or onchain contract method `verifyCandidate`.
   - Whitelist voters: Use admin API `/api/admin/whitelist-voter` to add voter addresses.

3. **Voting Interface (Voters)**
   - Connect wallet.
   - Browse active elections and positions. The frontend maps UI ids to onchain ids via `lib/contracts/id-map.ts`.
   - If whitelisted and election is active, cast vote. The client sends a signed transaction using the connected wallet client. The UI displays tx hash and progress, then updates once `VoteCast` event is observed.

4. **Transaction Tracking & Block Explorer**
   - All onchain transactions display the transaction hash in the UI.
   - Users can open transactions in a block explorer for Base Sepolia by combining the explorer base URL and the tx hash.

---

## Admin API Endpoints (server-side)

Routes are under `app/api/admin/*`. Examples:

- POST /api/admin/create-election
  - Payload: { title, description, startTime, endTime, initialPositions }
  - Returns: { txHash, onchainElectionId, events } on success (or error object)

- POST /api/admin/verify-candidate
  - Payload: { electionId, positionId, candidateId }
  - Returns: { txHash, status }

- POST /api/admin/whitelist-voter
  - Payload: { electionId, voter }
  - Returns: { txHash, status }

Notes:
- API endpoints perform server-side validation and must be protected in production. Use server-only secrets, authentication, or IP restrictions.
- Admin endpoints now integrate with the unified blockchain service layer in `lib/blockchain/thirdweb-service.ts` or `lib/blockchain/voting-service.ts` depending on implementation; prefer `voting-service.ts` for viem/wagmi interactions.

---

## Mapping UI IDs to Onchain IDs

- The UI uses human-friendly string IDs (e.g., "pos-president") while the contract uses numeric uint256 IDs.
- Use `lib/contracts/id-map.ts` to consistently map between UI and onchain IDs. This mapping can be persisted to localStorage or a simple server-side store for deterministic references.

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Unit tests live under `test/` and run with Hardhat (Mocha/Chai).
- Run:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  npx hardhat test
  ```

### End-to-End Testing
- Comprehensive E2E testing plan available in `e2e-integration-testing.md`
- Test blockchain integration, admin workflows, voting processes, and security measures
- Run automated test suites for complete system validation

### Script Validation
- Use `script-validation-plan.md` for comprehensive script testing
- Validate all npm scripts, contract compilation, and development server functionality

### Recommended Testing Flow
1. Run script validation: `script-validation-plan.md`
2. Execute unit tests: `npm test`
3. Run E2E integration tests: `e2e-integration-testing.md`
4. Validate production readiness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Wallet Connection Issues:**
- Ensure the wallet is unlocked and supports the connector chosen.
- Use the wallet UI to switch network or let the dApp call `useSwitchChain` (wagmi) to prompt switching to chainId 84532.
- Confirm NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID and NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL are correct.

**Missing Contract Address:**
- Confirm `lib/contracts/deployed-addresses.json` contains the network key (e.g., "baseSepolia") and a valid address.
- If missing, run deployment scripts or add the address manually to this JSON.

**Transaction Failures:**
- Inspect the transaction receipt and revert reason via the block explorer or local node logs.
- Verify input parameters: electionId > 0, correct position/candidate ids, valid timestamps.
- Ensure signer has enough ETH (or base token) for gas.

**ABI Mismatches:**
- Re-run `npm run hh:compile` to regenerate ABIs and artifacts.
- Ensure the frontend imports the ABI from `lib/contracts` that matches the deployed contract.

**Dependency Issues:**
- Run `fix-hardhat-version.bat` to resolve Hardhat dependency conflicts
- Use `generate-lockfile.bat` to create reproducible builds
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

**Event Subscription Issues:**
- Verify the `publicClient` RPC endpoint is correct and supports the event logs.
- Check the contract address and event signature names.

**Admin API Authentication:**
- Server-side admin endpoints rely on environment secrets; ensure PRIVATE_KEY and ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS are configured correctly for server signing or verification.

### Performance Optimization

**Development Server:**
- Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`
- Use `npm run build` for production builds
- Monitor memory usage during development

**Contract Compilation:**
- Use `npm run hh:compile --force` for clean compilation
- Monitor compilation times and optimize if needed
- Use incremental compilation for development

## Security & Best Practices

- Never commit private keys or sensitive environment variables to the repository.
- For production deployments, use secret management or CI environment secrets.
- Consider multi-signature (multi-sig) for any admin wallet used to create or control elections on mainnet.
- Add rate limiting and authentication for server-side admin APIs.
- Get a security audit prior to any mainnet deployments that will hold real value.
- Use reproducible builds with package-lock.json
- Regularly update dependencies and run security audits

---

## Development Tips

- Use NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_BLOCKCHAIN=false for rapid UI-only development if you need to stub blockchain calls (but the repo is designed to use the onchain flow).
- Use a local Hardhat node for debugging events and transactions quickly.
- Leverage React Query's invalidation on contract events (VoteCast, CandidateAdded, ElectionCreated) to keep UI in sync without heavy polling.
- Keep contract ABIs and deployed addresses up-to-date in `lib/contracts`.
- Use the automated scripts for dependency management and validation.

---

## Contributing

- Fork, create a branch, and open a pull request.
- Run tests and ensure `npm run hh:compile` is executed when modifying contracts.
- Update ABIs by using `npm run generate:abi` if contract interfaces change.
- Follow the testing procedures outlined in the testing documentation.
