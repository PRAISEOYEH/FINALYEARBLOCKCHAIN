# Admin Dashboard Validation Guide

This comprehensive validation guide ensures both admin dashboard components (`admin-dashboard.tsx` and `university-admin-dashboard.tsx`) are functioning correctly and provide a seamless administrative experience for the blockchain voting application.

## Overview

The admin system consists of two main dashboard components:
